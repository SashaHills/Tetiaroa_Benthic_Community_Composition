Abstract
Coral reefs are global biodiversity hotspots important for ocean health, providing ecosystem services 
for thousands of species (including humans). Coral benthic communities form the structural basis of these 
ecosystems, influencing numerous ecological processes and resulting ecosystem functions. For thousands of 
years, coral benthic communities have been driven by naturally occurring properties of the environment, 
which we refer to as biophysical drivers. However, as humans increasingly encroach on and alter coastal 
marine ecosystems, anthropogenic conditions may override biophysical drivers, making it difficult to identify 
the sources of changes in community composition and consequent ecosystem functioning. Here, we use 
multivariate analyses to demonstrate that bathymetric slope (surface steepness) and intercardinal bearing, a 
proxy for wind and wave exposure, are significant drivers of benthic composition across the remote atoll of 
Tetiaroa, French Polynesia, a coral reef seascape where the influences of biophysical conditions have not been 
previously investigated. Redundancy analysis concluded that together these biophysical variables explained 
66.02% of the variance in benthic community composition. Determining the most important drivers of coral 
community composition in this area of minimal human influence provides baseline data for natural coral reef 
ecosystems. This information will help us understand and predict coral community responses to changing 
environmental conditions, and guide conservation and restoration efforts of this ecologically important atoll.
